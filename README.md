In every field or department that’s working on modern rules, they work on web based application that performs automated functions and also these applications deal with customers to provide an ease to them. We are going to develop an automated web based sports portal for Comsats University. It deals with university students that participate in games. This web provides everything about sports for every viewer, sending alerts to sports coordinators and students, managing teams, managing matches schedule and showing results and rankings on the web. This web definitely provides ease in sports maintenance to the university’s faculty.
